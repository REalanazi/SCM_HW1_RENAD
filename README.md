# SCM_HW1_RENAD
This repository is created for the SWE 442 assignment on software configuration management. 
The purpose is to demonstrate version control, branching strategies, and change management in GitHub.
## Best Practices in Software Configuration Management  
- Use a version control system (like Git) to track changes.  
- Create separate branches for new features.  
- Write clear and meaningful commit messages.  
- Review code before merging.
